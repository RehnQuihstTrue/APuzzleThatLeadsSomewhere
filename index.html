        <h2>My? achievements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I? played TF2, until I got good at it. I was a good spy,
            mechanically speaking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> I? cared for my cats when my family wouldn't. </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            I? reached a reaction time of 127 average (it has significantly
            decayed, and rot back to the 250 average)
          </li>
          <li><strong> I? failed to learn Spanish </strong></li>
          <li>
            I? tested beyond average consistently for linguistic means of
            measurement
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              I? learned, to a semi-advanced degree, computing, and it's
              physical components
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>I? come to school late every day</li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              I? butchered an easy paid internship and future at a corporate
              cushy job because of "no mode of transport", even though it was
              just a 2 hour walk.
            </strong>
          </li>

          <li>
            I? questioned the moral and ethical beliefs of those around me, and
            quickly came to conclusions that would, in my mind, take others
            years to accept, and also display the capability to blind myself
            from these beliefs ignorantly in order to live a less stressful life
            with just will
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              I? achieved an understanding and formed a nuanced opinion on
              complex moral situations within minutes of encountering
              them.</strong>
          </li>
          <li> I? couldn't figure out IRC-chats, and largely, still can't make heads or tails of the system as a format, and how to get into it quickly </li>
        </li> <strong> I? still can't do basic math and arithmetic, especially not quickly. </strong>
        <li> I? have left my literary skills to rot, and still have no interest in pursuing creativity using them. </li>
        <li> <strong> I? have abandoned my passion to create at a quick rate and pace, and all my understanding of Unreal Engine has turned rotten as well. I still have the goal to make this game despite this... </strong> </li>
